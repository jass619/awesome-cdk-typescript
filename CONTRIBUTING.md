  ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/package-name)
  ![downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/package-name)
  ![last-commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/user/repo)
```

#### For Learning Resources

```markdown
- üìö [Resource Title](https://url) - Clear description of what readers will learn
```

### Code Examples

When adding code examples, ensure they are:

1. **Correct** - Test your code
2. **Concise** - Show the essential parts

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good Example
export class MyConstruct extends Construct {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: MyConstructProps) {
    super(scope, id);
    // Clear, typed implementation
  }
}

// ‚ùå Bad Example
export class MyConstruct extends Construct {

    super(scope, id);
  }
}
```
